      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Contradiction Engineering trains systems and people to stay coherent when their beliefs, incentives, or identities pull in opposite directions. Most collapse happens not from confusion, but from the pressure to resolve what feels impossible to hold.

Our work makes that pressure visible. Using the principles of Compression-Aware Intelligence, we map where strain accumulates, how contradictions form, and what causes collapse. Instead of forcing premature resolution, we teach how to think, design, and act inside tension without losing stability. According to CAI, Hallucination is a representational conflict problem. Compression strain measures it. CAI is the framework for evaluating it.</p>

      <p class="subtext">The Contradiction Engineering Lab exists to help individuals, teams, and intelligent systems develop the capacity to hold complexity without breaking. This is the foundation of clarity, resilience, creativity, and real intelligence.</p>

      <p>Compression-Aware Intelligence is the framework that treats hallucinations and contradictions not as errors to eliminate, but as measurable signals of representation strain inside any cognitive system, and uses those signals to guide stability, coherence, and self-correction.</p>
