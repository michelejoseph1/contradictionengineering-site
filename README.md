Compression-Aware Intelligence (CAI) links hallucination to representational conflict under semantic-equivalence rephrasing, and defines compression strain as the measurable signal of that conflict.
Compresssion-Aware Intelligence states that compression loss → contradiction → compression strain → instability. Hallucination is a representational conflict problem. Compression strain measures it. CAI is the framework for evaluating it.
When two prompts with the same meaning produce different outputs, the model’s latent representations are in conflict and Compression-Aware Intelligence (CAI) measures that conflict as compression strain.
